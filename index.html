        <p>
          Being born in Venezuela means you have to fit a specific manliness profile. You like Poetry? Gay. Ballet? Super gay. And of course, being super gay is the thing super worst that could happen to a man in Venezuela.
          <br><br>
          But then, at 25 years old (11 years ago), I would take a Master's Degree in Literature and learn that, in order to become the man you want to be, you have to get in touch with the Great Feminine, the Yin energy in you.
          <br><br>
          Back then I had injuries from soccer and weightlifting that didn't allow me to do combat sports. But after coming into contact with my feminine side, I decided to nurture those wounds, learn to live with them and to exercise according to them.   
          <br><br>
          To follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Wallace_(martial_artist)">Bill "Superfoot" Wallace</a>'s advice: "The guy who said no pain, no gain? He's DEAD! Let it heal, let it rest!".
          <br><br>
          So now I can proudly say that the most fun I had in 2019 involved getting my nose broken by my boxing coach and getting away with him not noticing during the fight. And that I love poetry as well as Ballet. 
          <br><br>
          Oh, and the picture in this section... That is NOT Billie "Superfoot" Wallace! That is one of darkest, funniest poets America has ever seen, and you will see her covered in my Final Project dedicated to my heroes.

        <p>
          Not fitting a manliness profile made me the bullied kid in school. And being 5'5 as well as not able to practice combat sports could have meant that I could have had to carry some childhood trauma forever with me. 
          <br><br>
          But then, the man in the picture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_Castellini">World Welterweight Champion Miguel Castellini</a>, would walk into frame.
          <br><br>
          It was in Argentina in 2018. I was boxing at Castellini's gym in Buenos Aires. Argentina is of European ancestry, so they are much taller in average than the rest of the Latinamerican region.
          <br><br>
          My first sparring partner in the country would be around 6'4. He destroys me.
          <br><br>
          But Castellini was watching. Castellini was old, with brain damage, but with the eyes of a champion still intact. He tells me that my stance is too wide to chase a taller opponent. That I need a footwork like Joe Frazier's
          <br><br>
          And so, Castellini puts me on a research path of boxing history that would change my life, and take my ability to face the ghosts of my bullies in the ring to a whole new level
          <br><br>
          More on that in the Final Project's section dedicated to Joe Frazier #SequelBaiting \(o_O)/.
